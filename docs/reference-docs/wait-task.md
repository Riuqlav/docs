# Wait

```json
"type" : "WAIT"
```

### Introduction

WAIT is used when the workflow needs to be paused for an external signal to continue.

### Use Cases

WAIT is used when the workflow needs to wait and pause for an external signal such as a human intervention
(like manual approval) or an event coming from an external source such as Kafka, SQS, or Conductor's internal queueing mechanism.

Some use cases where the WAIT task is used:

1. To add a human approval task. When the task is approved/rejected by a human WAIT task is updated using `POST /tasks` API to completion.
2. To wait for an external signal coming from an event queue mechanism supported by Conductor
